# Roguelike
(Credit for this code goes to https://github.com/jpelgrims/roguelike, I'm just keeping a Mirror of this Repo here)
(Additionally this code was built on top of ascii panel which can be found here: https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel.git)

A roguelike programmed in Java. The game currently contains a few creatures and basic dungeon generation, with more to come. It depends on asciiPanel for terminal emulation purposes.
